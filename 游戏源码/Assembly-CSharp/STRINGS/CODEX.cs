She's been featured in dozens of publications across the metaverse this year, and recently spent a record-breaking 3 weeks as the banner image for <i>Byte Magazine</i>. I'm talking, of course, about the Vertex Institute's AI ambassador...Florence!\n\n[sound of pre-recorded applause]\n\nWelcome to the show, Florence.\n\nFlorence: Thank you, Darryl. It's a pleasure to be back.\n\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\n\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\n\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\n\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet. It's called Onsite Health Medics, or OHM for short.\n\nWe're deploying specially trained models like myself into conflict zones, to provide urgently needed medical interventions for civilians and military personnel.\n\n(sound of pre-recorded applause)\n\nDarryl: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. What's the ratio of human techs to AI medics?\n\nFlorence: That's an outdated term, Darryl. We say \"Organics\" and \"Bionics,\" which describes the differences between our various team members more objectively.\n\nDarryl: Right. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.\n\nFlorence: That's okay, Darryl. We're all learning.\n\nDarryl: That's very good of you. Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\n\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\n\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\n\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\n\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\n\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\n\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\n\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\n\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\n\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\n\nFlorence: I could show you. Would you like me to?\n\nDarryl: What do you think, everyone? Should I get scanned?\n\n(sound of pre-recorded audience cheers)\n\nDarryl: You heard them! Go ahead. What do I do?\n\nFlorence: Just sit still, and count to twenty in your head.\n\n(a short silence, followed by a soft whirring sound)\n\nFlorence: Hmm.\n\nDarryl: Well, what's the verdict? Is it handsome in there, or what?\n\nFlorence: We should take a commercial break.\n\n<b>[FILE ENDS]</b>\n\n-----------\n";

I've assigned a technician to investigate. We cannot afford to lose even the smallest amount of power at this stage.\n\nNo one else seems to have noticed anything other than Dr. Ali. He says that the remote research access point project was also affected. It seems that the disruption restarted the entire teleportation system. The monitor is now displaying multiple shipping confirmation messages, despite the target building remaining in the departure dock. Reports show that an unknown number of access point blueprints have been disseminated. One shipment does appear to have reached Ceres, luckily, though it's quite far from the landing site.\n\nDr. Ali's entire team is working to determine how many others exist, and pinpoint their geographic and temporal locations.\n\nI am not optimistic.\n\nThe geologists insist that their equipment has recorded no seismic activity at all for several days.\n\nIt begs the question: What <i>was</i> it, if not an earthquake? Where did this event originate?\n\nDr. Ali quipped that maybe a Bow had malfunctioned in another timeline, which is absurd.\n\nIsn't it?";

Five hours from now, Subject #901 will make history as our first human test subject.\n\nEven at the Vertex Institute, which is twice Gravitas's size, I could've spent half my career waiting for approval to advance to human trials for such an invasive process! But Director Stern is too invested in this work to let it stagnate.\n\nMy darling Bruce always said that when you're on the right path, the universe conspires to help you. He'd be so proud of the work we do here.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nMy bio-printed multi-cerebral storage chambers (or \"mega minds\" as I've been calling them) are working! Just in time to save my job.\n\nThe Director's been getting increasingly impatient about our struggle to maintain the integrity of our growing datasets during extraction and processing. The other day, she held my report over a Bunsen burner until the flames reached her fingertips.\n\nI can only imagine how much stress she's under.\n\nThe whole world is counting on us.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nOn a hunch, I added dream content analysis to the data and...wow. Oneirology may be scientifically \"fluffy\", but integrating subconscious narratives has produced a new type of brainmap - one with more latent potential for complex processing.\n\nIf these results are replicable, we might be on the verge of unlocking the secret to creating synthetic life forms with the capacity to evolve beyond blindly following commands.\n\nNikola says that's irrelevant for our purposes. Surely Director Stern would disagree.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nNikola gave me a dataset to plug into the mega minds. He wouldn't say where it came from, but even if he had...nothing could have prepared me for what it contained.\n\nWhen he saw my face, he muttered something about how people should call me \"Tremors,\" not \"Nails\" and sent me on my lunch break.\n\nAll I could think about was those poor souls.\n\nDid they have souls?\n\n...do we?\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nIt's done. My adjustments to the memory transfer protocol are hardcoded into the machine.\n\nI finished just as Nikola stormed in.\n\nI may be too much of a coward to stand up for those unfortunate creatures, but with these new parameters in place...someday, they might be able to stand up for themselves.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n";

If this idea is ever going to work, we will either need to drastically improve the AI directing the subjects, or improve the brains of our Duplicants to the point where they possess higher cognitive functions.\n\nGiven the disastrous complications that I could foresee arising if our Duplicants were made less supplicant, I'm leaning toward a push to improve our Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, we will have to send a clean-up crew to destroy all evidence of our little experiment beneath the Ceres' surface.

That was the main intent behind this project.\"\n\nThe Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.\n\n\"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".\n\nFor those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet. The Facility says that although they have successfully transported matter through time, the technology was expressly developed for the purpose of energy generation and is ill-equipped for human transportation.";

I should be happy that this works so well, but several questions gnaw at my brain late at night.\n\nIf Time's Arrow is moving forward the Laws of Entropy declare that the universe should be moving from a state of order to one of chaos. If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!\n\nThis suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions. Fundamentally, this proves the existence of other timelines - different dimensions - some of which we can assume have also built their own Temporal Bow.\n\nThe promise of crossing this final dimensional threshold is too tempting. Imagine what things Gravitas has invented in another dimension!! I must find a way to tear open the fabric of spacetime and tap into the limitless human potential of a thousand alternate timelines.";

This in-depth dissection of the subject would produce the results we need but at the expense of destroying the host.\n\nOf course this is not ideal for our current situation. The time and energy it took to recruit Gravitas' highly trained staff would be wasted if we were to extirpate these people for the sake of experimentation. But perhaps we can use our Duplicants as experimental subjects until we perfect the process and look into finding volunteers for the future in order to obtain an ideal specimen. I will have to discuss this with Dr. Techna but I'm sure he would be enthusiastic about such an opportunity to continue his work.\n\nI am also very interested in the commercial opportunities this presents. Off the top of my head I can think of applications in genetics, AI development, and teleportation technology. This could be a significant financial windfall for the company.\n\n[LOG ENDS]";
